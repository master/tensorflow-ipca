# Incremental PCA in TensorFlow

Implementation of the incremental principal component analysis (IPCA) [1] in
TensorFlow. IPCA is typically used as a replacement for principal component
analysis (PCA) when the dataset to be decomposed is too large to fit in
memory.

## Requirements

 * Python 3.5+
 * TensorFlow 1.6+
